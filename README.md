# 1828-dictionary

You can see this in action at <1828.mshaffer.com>

- The 1828 dictionary came from Gutenberg and cleansed.
- The 1844 dictionary came from a BYU website at some point (scraped and cleansed).
- The 1913 dictionary came from Gutenberg and cleansed.

## TODO

- I will try and develop a tool to "show" the original entries from PDFs of these dictionaries.
- I have developed an XML tool to allow users to contribute to the 1828 "manual-turk" (mturk) cleanup process.  I will review and also make accessible for other dictionaries and generic documents.
